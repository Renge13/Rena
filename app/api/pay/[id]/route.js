// REYNER-APPROVED 2026-08-05. This string is on the Xendit checkout page and on
// the bank/e-wallet statement line, so it is user-facing chrome and rule 20
// applies: keyboard characters only, one composed voice.
//
// INTERIM, and it describes what the buyer ACTUALLY RECEIVES. It names the same
// product the funnel names — `Bacaan Mendalam`, the string already on the paywall
// at components/Funnel.jsx:587 and :712 — so the checkout page, the statement line
// and the offer the buyer accepted all read alike.
//
// TWO SUPERSESSIONS, both this interim. `Katon - CE card + PDF reading` described
// the intended Complete Edition, while the paid path delivers the 7-beat unlock
// with no PDF and no hi-res card in it: charging for one thing and delivering
// another is a merchant-compliance problem in its own right. Its replacement
// `Katon - Bacaan lengkap` fixed the delivery mismatch and introduced a copy one —
// `lengkap` is the free reading's own claim on /harga, so the paid line borrowed
// the word that is supposed to distinguish the free product. Superseded by Reyner
// 2026-08-05 for that collision. See the 2026-08-05 interim section in
// docs/PROGRESS.md; when paid really is card + PDF, this string names them again.
//
// The pre-pivot `Katon: Bacaan Mendalam (${row.domain})` is still dead: it sold a
// per-domain reading, and the domain is not a product. The product name returning
// here is not that string returning — there is no domain in it.
// SWAPPED 2026-08-23 WITH THE PROMOTION, and the note above is its own instruction:
// "when paid really is card + PDF, this string names them again." It does now.
//
// NOT THE OLD STRING BACK. `Katon - CE card + PDF reading` was the pre-08-05 value
// and it is NOT restored, because the delivery mismatch was only half of what was
// wrong with it: it is English on an Indonesian buyer's bank statement, and `CE` is
// an internal abbreviation for a product page that spells the name out. Rule 20 is
// one composed voice EVERYWHERE INCLUDING CHROME, and a statement line is chrome.
//
// So this reuses the two strings that already carry Reyner's approval -
// `SITE_COPY.harga.artifact.name` and the funnel's own offer heading, both
// `Complete Edition` - and adds nothing. Keyboard characters only, no em-dash.
//
// APPROVED BY REYNER, 2026-08-22. He had approved `Complete Edition` as a product NAME
// on 2026-08-03 (the EN tier layer) and had not seen it as a statement line; it was
// flagged here for exactly that reason, and the flag is now closed. The wording is his.
//
// ── `compat` IS UNRULED AND THAT IS DELIBERATE, 2026-09-07 ──
// It comes from `COMPAT_COPY.invoiceDesc` as an `@@UNRULED@@` sentinel, so
// `scripts/check-unruled-copy.mjs` (wired as `prebuild`) REFUSES a production
// build until Reyner rules it. Preview and local builds pass on purpose - he has
// to see it in context to rule it.
//
// WHY NOT GUESS ONE. The history above is three supersessions of this exact
// surface, two of them for reasons a guess would have repeated: English on an
// Indonesian buyer's bank statement, and borrowing the free product's own word.
// Guessing here has a measured track record of being wrong, and the alternative
// to a sentinel was holding the whole payment path on one string.
