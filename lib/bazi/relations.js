// ============================================================
// Chart-level branch relations (六合 三合 半合 冲 害)
// ============================================================
// getHarmonyBranches / getClashBranches in stems.js answer "what harmonises with
// THIS branch". Stage 3 needs the different question: which relations are
// actually PRESENT among the chart's own four branches, and in which positions.
// A relation with no position is not a fact a reading can use — CR-6 reads every
// marker through its palace.
//
// 刑 is deliberately not here. It is already computed by branchPunishments and
// hangs off chart.punishments; a second entry point would be a second source of
// truth for the same table.
//
// ── ON THE TWO TABLES DEFINED IN THIS FILE ─────────────────
// SIX_HARMS (六害) is not in stems.js. It is the standard table and it is written
// down in docs/content/glossary.json under relasi_cabang.害.pairs, which is the
// Reyner-reviewed content file: 子未 丑午 寅巳 卯辰 申亥 酉戌. The spec test asserts
// this file and the glossary agree, so the two cannot drift. THAT SPEC IS
// `tests/stage3-facts.spec.mjs:234`, not `tests/relations.spec.mjs` - the name this
// header used until 2026-09-07, which has never existed
// (`ls tests/relations.spec.mjs` -> No such file or directory). A guard cited by
// the wrong path reads as an absent guard, and the guard is real.
//
// TRINE_SETS duplicates the members of the private TRINES const in strength.ts.
// That duplication is deliberate and guarded rather than removed: strength.ts is
// closed (D2 "do not touch the strength engine"), so instead of reaching into it,
// tests/stage3-facts.spec.mjs:234 asserts the two tables agree member-for-member. If
// strength.ts is ever opened for other reasons, collapse these into one export.
