// ============================================================
// lib/compat/complementarity.js — CROSS-CHART element complementarity (P3 facts)
// ============================================================
// FACTS ONLY. No prose, no score, no interpretation string. Rule 14: the engine
// owns all facts, hierarchy and structure; the LLM chooses only words.
//
// The question, per prompt W: for each direction, does the other chart carry
// presence in the element this chart's favourable-element logic names?
//
// ── WHAT IS REUSED, AND WHY THESE TWO AND NOT OTHERS ───────
//   computeStrength(chart).favorable   lib/bazi/strength.ts, returned at :660
//       Already ordered by scarcity: `byScarcity` (:629) sorts ascending on
//       elementTotals, so favorable[0] is the scarcest and therefore the most
//       needed. THIS MODULE DOES NOT RE-RANK THAT LIST. It walks the engine's own
//       priority order and takes the first element the other chart can actually
//       supply, which is why an emitted fact carries its rank: rank 1 means the
//       first choice was unavailable, and that is a different fact from rank 0.
//   elementPresence(chart)             lib/semantic/facts.js:121
//       Presence as percent of the chart's total weight, computed over
//       `chart.elementBalance` = countElements() at lib/bazi/buildChart.js:80.
//
// NO STRENGTH IS RECOMPUTED HERE. `computeStrength` is called only when the caller
// does not already hold its output, and nothing in this file reimplements any part
// of it. Rule 7's closed files - lib/bazi/tenGods.js and lib/bazi/mainProfile.js -
// are not imported, and the spec asserts the import list.
//
// PRESENCE IS NOT STRENGTH, AND CONFLATING THEM IS THE LIVE FORM OF RULE 9.
// `strength.elementStrength` is a seasonal strength DISTRIBUTION;
// `elementPresence` counts what the chart actually holds. A supplier can only
// supply what it HOLDS, so presence is the right input and `elementStrength` is
// never read. Rule 9's named function, `buildElementBars`, lived in
// lib/readingView.js and was deleted at the 2026-08-23 promotion
// (`grep -rn "buildElementBars" lib/` -> comments in strength.ts only), so it
// cannot be reached; the spec keeps the assertion anyway, against its return.
//
// ABSENCE MEANS EXACTLY ZERO, AND THAT THRESHOLD IS NOT INVENTED HERE.
// lib/semantic/facts.js:297 fires its `element_absent` fact on `if (pct > 0)
// continue`, so absent is presence === 0. `sameImbalance` uses the same test, so a
// gap this module reports is the same gap the reading already calls missing.
//
// ── ENGLISH ELEMENT KEYS, DELIBERATELY ────────────────────
// Elements stay as the engine's own 'Wood' | 'Fire' | 'Earth' | 'Metal' | 'Water'.
// `elementId()` (lib/semantic/glossary.js:35) returns an Indonesian display name,
// and prompt W bars any Indonesian string from lib/compat/. Mapping to Indonesian
// is the semantic layer's job when tranche 2 builds reading facts out of these.
//
// ── WHAT THIS DOES NOT SAY ────────────────────────────────
// Nothing here means "compatible". Ruling A (Reyner, 2026-09-07) keeps
// cross-chart MEANING in the content layer: that one chart holds an element the
// other's strength verdict favours is a FACT, and what it is worth to a
// relationship is not the engine's to decide.
