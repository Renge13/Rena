//
// ── WHY THE HANDLERS LIVE IN lib/ AND NOT IN THE ROUTE FILE ─
// Two reasons, both about the tests J is required to have.
//   1. `@/` is a bundler alias. A route file that imports `@/lib/...` cannot be
//      loaded by `node --test` at all, so route-level tests would have to be
//      replaced by "tests of the things the route calls" — which is exactly the
//      coverage that misses a wiring bug.
//   2. These return a plain Web `Response`, not a `NextResponse`. Next 15 accepts
//      either; only one of them is importable outside a bundler (`next/server`
//      has no `exports` map, so raw node ESM cannot resolve it).
// The route files stay thin so this indirection never becomes a place where
// behaviour hides.
