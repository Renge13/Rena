// ============================================================
// lib/pair/handlers.js — POST /api/pair
// ============================================================
// Creates a `pair`: two people's birth inputs, one purchase, one report.
//
// ══ WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, AND IT IS MOST OF THE FILE'S POINT ══
// Ruled by Reyner 2026-09-07 (night), verbatim in docs/prompts/X-compat-2b1.md:
//
//   "No free P0 reading, no named relation tease, and no Gemini render before
//    payment. The pre-payment Compat flow should be deterministic/static and
//    cheap. The AI compatibility report is generated only after successful
//    payment."
//
// So this COMPUTES NOTHING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP. No chart is built, no
// archetype is named, no `lib/compat/*` module is called and no renderer is
// touched. It validates two births, resolves the season gate, and writes a row.
// The spec asserts the response and the stored row carry no hanzi and no fact
// key, because a create that quietly built the facts "to validate them" would be
// a free compat result sitting in the database.
//
// ══ PERSON B NEVER BECOMES A `reading` ROW ══════════════════
// The other ruling the same night: person B gets no mirror, no reading, no link,
// no notification, no account. A `reading` row IS a reachable URL - its id is a
// CSPRNG bearer token and `GET /api/mirror/[token]` serves it to whoever holds
// it - so a reading row for B is an openable reading OF B whatever any UI links.
// Both births live on the pair row and both charts are computed in memory at
// serve time. `tests/pair-route.spec.mjs` counts reading rows across a create.
//
// ══ THE 409 IS A NEW PATTERN, NOT A COPY OF THE MIRROR ══════
// Prompt X-b1 says the 409 works "exactly as the mirror flow does for one". IT
// DOES NOT: the mirror's season gate is CLIENT-side. `components/Funnel.jsx:329`
// calls `POST /api/season-check` first and only then creates the reading, and
// `app/api/season-check/route.js` says why in its own words - so the reading is
// created ONCE with the resolved answer "instead of being written and then
// mutated". There is no 409 anywhere in the mirror flow.
//
// The 409 here is still right, and the reason is that prompt X-b1 requires this
// to be verifiable end to end with curl BEFORE any UI exists. With no client
// there is nobody to ask the question in advance, so the server has to refuse and
// name what it needs. It keeps the mirror's actual invariant - a row is written
// once, with the answer already in it - which is why the 409 writes nothing.
// X-b3's UI may ask up front like the funnel does; this endpoint stays correct
// either way.
