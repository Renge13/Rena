// lib/pair/serveReading.js — GET /api/pair/[id]/reading
// ============================================================
// The paid compat report: facts AND prose. Same pipeline as the mirror -
// `renderReading` -> Gemini -> Stage 6 -> `render_cache` -> floor on refusal -
// consuming the pair semantic JSON as a second instance of one contract.
//
// ══ THE GATE IS servePairFacts's, DELIBERATELY THE SAME ═════
// Unpaid gets `{ status: 'not_paid', sku, price }` and NOTHING else - not an
// archetype, not a relation, no hanzi. Ruling 3 (2026-09-07): no free compat
// result and no Gemini render before payment. **The render is not merely hidden
// from an unpaid caller; it is never STARTED**, so an unpaid request cannot spend
// a provider call.
//
// ══ RULE 16: THE FLOOR IS SERVED AND NEVER STORED ══════════
// `persistRendered` is the single door and it refuses `module_assembly` itself,
// so this path cannot store a floor even by mistake. That matters more here than
// on the mirror: a stored floor would cost a PAYING customer their real reading
// permanently, because the next request is a cache hit and the chain never runs
// again until ENGINE_VERSION moves.
//
// ══ WHAT THIS COMMIT DOES NOT HAVE, AND IT IS STATED HERE ══
// **The compat Stage 6 checks are NOT in the pipeline yet.** Prompt X-b2's
// commit 3 adds `both_named`, `no_verdict` and `reframe_present`, and it is
// BLOCKED: each rejecting check must first be shown red on a REAL Gemini render,
// and no `GEMINI_API_KEY` was available. So a pair render is validated today by
// the GENERIC Stage 6 checks only - the shape, coverage, style and forbidden
// content rules that apply to any reading.
//
// The consequence, plainly: **nothing currently enforces that both people are
// named in the opening, or that the P2 reframe is present when the flag is
// raised.** Both are ruled requirements. Until commit 3 lands, this endpoint must
// not be put in front of a reader. There is no UI for it, which is what makes
// that acceptable rather than a live defect.
