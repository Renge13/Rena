// ============================================================
// SKU price table — the single source of truth for what anything costs
// ============================================================
// Prices: docs/product/launch-decisions.md §"Price architecture" (CONFIRMED by
// Reyner 2026-08-02, numbers and mechanic both).
//
// THE MECHANIC. List is the public anchor and NEVER rises; the launch price
// (harga peluncuran) is the only test variable. Two asymmetries drive it:
// raising a list price later is nearly impossible and discounting is free, so
// the list anchors at the top and the discount moves. And the discount is
// VISIBLE and cohort-wide, never a silent A/B — a discount is a story people
// accept, while a silent price difference screenshotted between friends reads
// as cheating.
//
// SECURITY. The webhook validates the RE-FETCHED Xendit invoice amount against
// this table (never against the callback body), so a forged callback with an
// arbitrary amount cannot unlock. No client path supplies a price, and no client
// path supplies a SKU-to-price mapping — a client may name a SKU, and the name
// is resolved to a number here, on the server.
//
// PRICE_IDR (Rp 49.000) is GONE. It was the pre-pivot domain-reading price,
// superseded in CLAUDE.md's SUPERSEDED list, and nothing else in the repo knew.
// Both of its consumers moved to priceFor() in the same commit, so no shim.
// ============================================================

/**
 * THE LADDER, ruled by Reyner 2026-08-29.
 *
 * Authority is `docs/product/paid-product-map.md` `## RULED 2026-08-29`. This
 * table implements it; it does not decide it.
 *
 *   launch   19 -> 39 -> 79        mature   29 -> 49 -> 99
 *
 * FOUR PRODUCTS, FOUR DIFFERENT JOBS, and the ladder is not depth:
 *   artifact  OWNERSHIP    "I want to keep this."   NOT a deeper reading -
 *                          nothing is withheld from the free mirror to make it.
 *   compat    CURIOSITY    "What about me and them?"
 *   annual    ORIENTATION  "What kind of year is this?"
 * (The free mirror is RECOGNITION and is not a SKU.)
 *
 * WHY artifact STAYS AT 19.000 while its list rises to 29.000: its job is not
 * ARPU, it is converting a free reader into a paying customer at all. 19k is an
 * impulse "why not"; at 29k she justifies the purchase consciously, which is the
 * wrong mental motion for a keepsake.
 *
 * WHY compat IS 39.000 AND NOT 29.000: 29k reads as a cheap digital curiosity.
 * Another person is involved and the emotional stake is higher than a keepsake's.
 *
 * WHY annual IS 79.000 AND NOT 49.000: at 49k it reads as an inexpensive digital
 * reading; 79k reads as "my personal reading for the year" while staying under
 * the psychologically loaded 100.000 line. THE PRESENTATION CARRIES THIS PRICE,
 * NOT THE PAGE COUNT.
 *
 * NEITHER compat NOR annual IS ASSUMED TO BE THE MONEY PRODUCT. September's
 * demand test decides, and no code, comment or copy may encode the assumption in
 * either direction. CLAUDE.md calls compat "the money engine" as a PRODUCT
 * statement; it is not a measurement and it is not a launch precondition.

/**
 * SKUs a checkout may actually create an invoice for TODAY.
 *
 * `annual` is priced but NOT sellable: it is not built and there is nothing to
 * deliver. Pricing a thing and selling a thing are separate decisions, and taking
 * money for an unbuilt product is the failure this list exists to prevent.
 *
 * ── `compat` BECAME SELLABLE 2026-09-07, AND WHAT CHANGED IS DELIVERY ──
 * This docblock said compat was unsellable "because nothing is delivered", which
 * was true and is the correct test. It is no longer true: prompt X-b1 builds the
 * pair, the checkout, the verified paid flip and `GET /api/pair/[id]`, which
 * serves the deterministic compat facts to a paid buyer. So something IS
 * delivered, and the fence opens for the reason it was closed rather than because
 * the product got closer.
 *
 * **WHAT A BUYER GETS AT THIS COMMIT IS FACTS, NOT PROSE.** The AI report is
 * X-b2. That is a real limit on the product and it is written here because this
 * list is where someone checks whether taking the money is honest yet: a paid
 * pair returns its relational facts, deterministically, with no renderer in the
 * path. If X-b2 slips, this line is the one to reconsider - not a UI decision.
 *
 * THIS LIST IS THE FENCE, and 2026-08-29 is when it started carrying two products
 * instead of one. `annual` was added to SKUS in the same commit that left it off
 * this list, deliberately: September's demand test shows both products at their
 * launch prices and records interest, and a price has to exist to be shown. A
 * commit that makes `annual` reachable from `/api/pay` is wrong, and the
 * checkout route test asserts the 400.

 * storage), an amount belonging to a different SKU, and an amount from the
 * wrong TIER — list while launch pricing is active, or the reverse.
 *
 * The strict single-tier check is deliberate and is what the per-SKU rewrite
 * buys over the old global constant. OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCE, stated so it is
 * not discovered during a flip: an invoice created before a LAUNCH_PRICING
 * change and settled after it will NOT unlock. Drain in-flight invoices before
 * flipping the lever. Widening this to accept both tiers would remove the
