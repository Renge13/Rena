// Fixed-window rate limiting
// ============================================================
// CLAUDE.md rule 19: "Rate-limit per IP/session. No bulk endpoint. No enumerable
// reading URLs. The real abuse risk is content harvesting, not API cost (the
// entire mirror space costs ~$115 to cache forever)."
//
// That last clause decides the SHAPE of this. If the risk were API cost the
// limiter would sit in front of the renderer; because the risk is harvesting the
// CACHED corpus, the limit has to sit in front of every read, hit or miss. A
// harvester's requests are all cache hits by definition — they cost nothing and
// take everything.
//
// ── TWO DIMENSIONS, AND WHAT EACH ONE ACTUALLY BUYS ────────
// Per-session (an httpOnly cookie) bounds an honest browser. It does NOT bound
// an attacker: dropping the cookie mints a new session. Per-IP is the dimension
// that binds a scraper, and it is deliberately the looser of the two, because
// Indonesian mobile traffic arrives through carrier NAT and a strict per-IP cap
// would throttle a whole city block of real users. Neither is sufficient alone;
// the pair is, which is why rule 19 names both.
//
// ── FAIL CLOSED ────────────────────────────────────────────
// A backend error is a REFUSAL, not a pass. An unlimited endpoint is the exact
// state rule 19 forbids, and "the limiter was broken" is not a reason to enter
// it. Same philosophy as lib/paymentFence.js and lib/render/config.js: a
// misconfigured deploy fails loudly rather than degrading into something that
// looks fine from outside.
//
// ── BACKENDS ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// Supabase when configured, else a process-local Map — the same pattern as
// readingStore.js and render/cache.js. The Map is for local dev and tests ONLY.
// On Vercel it would not limit a rate, it would limit a rate PER LAMBDA
// INSTANCE, resetting on every cold start. Requires migration 0008.

  // ── SPEND GUARD (a): renders per cache key per hour ───────
  // NOT a harvesting limit, and the only bucket here that is not. Rule 19 says
  // the abuse risk is content harvesting rather than API cost, and that is still
  // true of READS - but it stopped being the whole story once the floor rate was
  // ACCEPTED at 10% rather than treated as a defect on its way out (Reyner,
  // 2026-08-22).
  //
  // THE MECHANISM IT BOUNDS, which is a right rule with a standing cost. Rule 16
  // forbids persisting a floor, so a floored reader who reloads gets a genuinely
  // fresh render - that SELF-HEALS quality, and `tests/mirror-route.spec.mjs`
  // pins it as correct: "the second request must retry the provider, not serve a
  // frozen floor". The same sentence describes unbounded cost. A chart that keeps
  // flooring re-renders on every request forever, and every one of those is a
  // provider call nothing caches.
  //
  // WHY THE DIMENSION IS THE CACHE KEY AND NOT THE CLIENT. The cost is per
  // CHART, not per person: two readers of one shared link are the same spend, and
  // one reader reloading is the same spend again. A session or IP bucket cannot
  // see either, and both already have buckets above for the harvesting risk.
  //
  // THREE PER HOUR, and the tuning target is Reyner's: one reload must still
  // heal. Attempt 1 is the reader's first visit. A reload spends 2, a second
  // reload spends 3, and only the fourth render inside the hour is refused into
  // the floor - so the self-healing property survives with a spare, while a
  // pathological chart costs at most 3 chains an hour instead of one per request.
  // UNFITTED, like every number in this file: an opening guess against a
  // behaviour nobody has observed on real traffic, not a measurement.

  // the only one bounding total spend rather than one actor's share of it. Guards
  // (a) and (b) bound how often ONE chart renders and neither bounds how many
  // charts exist; an unbounded number of distinct cache keys sits inside both.
  //
  // The limit lives in lib/render/config.js as DAILY_ATTEMPT_CEILING, next to the
  // other render budgets and with the arithmetic behind it, and is injected at the
  // call site. A spend ceiling read from the rate-limiter's table would be the one
  // number about render cost that is not with the render config.
