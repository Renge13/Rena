// moves the chain along. pipeline-spec lists "response empty/garbled -> treat as
// failure, same fallover chain", and an invented fact id is the same class of
// event one level up - the provider produced something that is not a reading.

// SPEND GUARD (b) — IN-FLIGHT DE-DUPLICATION
// ============================================================
// Nothing de-duplicated a render that was already running. `readCache` returns a
// finished row or null, so every concurrent miss for one chart started its own
// full chain - and against the funnel's 3s poll and a measured p50 of 7.6s per
// attempt (up to ~23s at three attempts), that is roughly EIGHT polls inside one
// render, each one a separate provider chain for the same chart.
//
// IT IS NOT A POLL BUG, which is why the fix lives here and not in the poll. The
// same hazard fires on a plain refresh, two open tabs, or a shared link opened
// twice. The poll is only the loudest caller.
//
// ── WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT ──────────────────────
// A process-local promise map. Concurrent callers for one cache key await ONE
// chain and all receive its result.
//
// IT DOES NOT DE-DUPLICATE ACROSS INSTANCES, and that limitation is the reason
// this guard travels with guard (a) rather than instead of it. Serverless
// instances share no memory, so two lambdas holding the same chart still run two
// chains. Guard (a) is the cross-instance bound - it goes through Supabase, so
// three renders per key per hour holds however many instances are involved. This
// one collapses the same-instance burst, which is the shape the poll actually
// produces: one browser, one keep-alive connection, one instance.
//
// The DEFERRED REGISTER row called an in-process map "a cheap complement, not the
// fix", and that is still the honest description. The fix it named - kick the
// render once when the reading is created, let the poll read a status - is a
// funnel change and belongs to the promotion commit. This is the complement,
// landed with the bound that makes it sufficient for now.
//
// ── WHY THE KEY IS NOT JUST THE CACHE KEY ─────────────────
// A shared promise hands the FIRST caller's options to every later one. Two
// callers wanting the same chart with different `validationRetries` or
// `allowUnvalidatedCache` want different renders, and silently serving one the
// other's result would be a correctness bug wearing a performance fix's clothes.
// So the map key carries a signature of every option that can change the RESULT.
//
// An injected `fetchImpl` cannot go in a signature at all, so it is compared by
// REFERENCE on the in-flight entry: share only if it is the identical function
// object, which is trivially true in production where both are undefined.
//
// Reference comparison rather than "never share when injected", which was the
// first cut and was wrong for a reason worth keeping: a test transport is the only
// way to exercise this guard without buying a render, so refusing to share under
// injection would have made the guard permanently untestable. A guard nothing can
// test is a guard nobody can trust.

  // attemptsPerProvider 2, budgets of 1, 2 and 3 all produced exactly 2 provider
  // calls. Setting the budget to 2 without this would have changed nothing and
  // looked like it had.
  //
  // So each event now draws on its own counter, which is what makes the number
  // above mean what it says:
  //   transportLeft      identical retries after a retryable failure. A 503 is
  //                      worth the same call again.
  //   regenerationsLeft  calls that have been TOLD what was wrong. A reading that
  //                      says "kuat" about a weak chart is not worth repeating.

/**
 * Stage 7's store half. THE ONLY WAY A RENDER BECOMES SERVABLE.
 *
 * Refuses while the Stage 6 gate does not exist, so the pre-H state cannot be
 * bypassed by calling this directly. Prompt H sets STAGE6_VERSION and this
 * starts working; nothing else has to change.
 *
 * ── THE FLOOR SERVES, IT DOES NOT STORE (rule 16, amended 2026-08-07) ──
 * A module-assembled result means the providers could not deliver: an outage, a
 * rate limit, two validation failures. Freezing that into the cache would let a
 * one-hour Gemini blip cost those charts their real reading PERMANENTLY, because
 * the next request is a cache hit and the chain never runs again. The key only
 * moves when ENGINE_VERSION does, which may be months.
 *
 * So the floor is served and discarded, and the next request retries. The
 * determinism guarantee is unharmed where it matters: it now reads "deterministic
 * after the first generation THAT PASSES STAGE 6", and a floor result never was
 * one - `assembleFallback` is pure engine content, so re-deriving it is
 * byte-identical anyway. The only visible consequence is that a reader who saw
 * the floor during an outage sees the real reading afterwards, which is the
 * direction anyone would choose.
 *
 * Enforced HERE rather than in the caller because this is the single door. A
 * rule that lives in one route is a rule the next route does not know about.
 *
 * @param {Object} rendered the result of renderReading
 * @param {Object} semanticJson the JSON it was rendered from
 * @returns {Promise<boolean>} true when a row was written, false when the result
 *   was the floor and was deliberately not stored.
