// ============================================================
// Stage 3, PHASE 1 — fact inventory. No scoring.
// ============================================================
// Emits every fact a chart supports, unranked, in a stable order. Phase 2 scores
// them; Phase 3 wraps them in the JSON contract. Nothing here decides importance,
// and nothing here writes a user-facing string.
//
// THE TARGET IS docs/content/provecell-01-USER.json — hand-authored for fixture
// chart 1 and the only shape validated against a real renderer.
//
// ── WHY provenance IS STRUCTURED AND NOT PROSE ─────────────
// The target file carries provenance as finished Indonesian sentences ("Cabang
// bulanmu adalah Ayam. Dihitung dari pilar harimu, Ayam justru jatuh di posisi
// kosong."). Those sentences exist nowhere in glossary.json, so producing them
// means Stage 3 authoring new user-facing copy — which D2 forbids ("do not
// generate any prose, every user-facing string comes from the glossary") and
// which Reyner alone can approve on register.
//
// Phase 1 therefore emits provenance as DATA: which positions, which branches,
// which elements, which palace. The sentence layer is a separate decision that
// belongs in Phase 3, flagged for register review, not smuggled in here. The data
// is strictly richer than the sentence, so nothing is lost by deferring.
//
// ── WHAT PHASE 1 DOES NOT DO ───────────────────────────────
// No importance, no ranking, no quiet_chart, no required_points, no cache key.
// gift/cost are the glossary SEEDS passed through unconditioned; see contentFrom.

 *   A kind is actionable if it names a CONDITION THE READER CAN RESPOND TO,
 *   not a DISPOSITION SHE IS.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS DECLARED AND NOT INFERRED ──────────────────
 * The hierarchy's actionability axis used to read `fact.actionable`, which is
 * the PROSE from glossary.actionable_seed. So a fact counted as actionable if
 * and only if someone had written its sentence yet, and authoring content
 * re-ranked charts: the tranche-1 pass moved fact order on 11 of 13 charts for
 * reasons that had nothing to do with the charts.
 *
 * Rule 14 says the engine owns order, so order must be a function of the CHART.
 * The prose still renders and still appears in `must_cover`; it simply stops
 * being a ranking input. Writing an actionable no longer changes rank.
 *
 * ── WHY NOT DECLARE NEARLY EVERYTHING TRUE ─────────────────
 * Because that recreates the degeneracy this replaces. A binary bonus awarded to
 * every kind ranks nothing, which is exactly what the inferred version was
 * heading for as the content pass approached full coverage - the difference
 * being that it would then be permanent instead of transitional. 7 true and 5
 * false discriminates, and the line above is what decides which is which.
 *
 * Keyed on `provenance.kind`, the domain the fact came from. That is why the
 * table cannot reproduce the values the prose implied: five `aspek` cells gained
 * an actionable_seed in tranche 1 and sit under kinds declared false here. Their
 * prose still ships. It just no longer buys them rank.

 * ── THE PALACE DOMAIN RIDES WITH THE PALACE ────────────────
 * Added 2026-08-12. QA finding 5 is that a palace name alone reads as an internal
 * variable, and the fix Reyner ruled is to WEAVE the life-domain gloss into the
 * first palace mention in prose. The renderer cannot weave what it cannot see, so
 * every fact that names a palace now carries that palace's domain beside it.
 *
 * Derived here rather than at each call site, so a fact cannot acquire a palace
 * without its domain: the two are one piece of provenance, not two fields to
 * remember. A multi-palace fact gets a MAP keyed by palace name, never a parallel
 * array - see the relation fact below for the mis-zip that would otherwise be
 * available to the renderer.
 *
 * IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN `must_cover`. That list is built from what a fact
 * carries (lib/semantic/index.js#requiredPoints), and adding the domain there would
 * demand the gloss on EVERY palace mention - the opposite of the ruling, which is
 * first mention only, once. Coverage stays a contract about the fact's own strings.
