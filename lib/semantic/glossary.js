// ============================================================
// Glossary access for Stage 3
// ============================================================
// docs/content/glossary.json is the ENGINE CONTENT TABLE. Every user-facing
// string in the semantic JSON is read from it. Stage 3 never writes one.
//
// Rule 14: the engine owns all facts, the LLM chooses only words. That cuts both
// ways — Stage 3 inventing a label is the same violation as the renderer
// inventing a finding, just one stage earlier.
//
// ── ELEMENT NAMES ──────────────────────────────────────────
// The strength engine speaks English (Wood, Fire); every user-facing surface
// speaks Indonesian (Kayu, Api). That translation goes through glossary.elemen
// and nowhere else. The English -> hanzi bridge below is DERIVED by inverting the
// glossary's own name_en values rather than hardcoded, so there is exactly one
// place the pairing is written down and a second map cannot silently drift from
// it (D2a §5).
//
// NOTE, flagged not fixed: lib/readingView.js carries its own ELEMENT_ID map that
// renders Earth as "Bumi", while the glossary says "Tanah". That surface predates
// the glossary and is out of Stage 3's scope, but it is the exact drift this
// derivation exists to prevent.

// ── TEMPLATE CELLS ─────────────────────────────────────────
// A cell marked `_template: true` carries SLOTS - `{A}`, `{B}` - that the engine
// fills at fact-build time. `kompatibilitas.p0_opening` is the first and, at the
// time of writing, the only one: the opening has to name both people, the names
// are per-pair, and a ruled sentence cannot contain them. Reyner ruled the
// sentence WITH the slots, so every word a reader sees is still his and the
// engine supplies only two names it already owns.
//
// **`{` AND `}` TRIP `style.code_leak`, CORRECTLY** - a brace in prose is the
// model echoing its input structure back at the reader. So a raw template is not
// prose and must never be swept as prose. Two consequences, both enforced rather
// than remembered:
//   - the FACT carries the filled string, never the template (lib/semantic/pair.js)
//   - a glossary sweep fills first, via `sweepableGlossary()` below
// The marker is `_`-prefixed because it is metadata, like `_note`: it is not a
// string Reyner ruled, so it must not be counted as an assignment by
// `scripts/apply-rulings.mjs --expect` or by the section's shape test.

 * instruction that named it explicitly). The renderer was handed a position ARRAY
 * and asked to say all of it; it kept saying two of three. Handing it the finished
 * phrase removes the step it was failing at.
 *
 * This is a DATA JOIN, not copy. Every name comes from `GLOSSARY.pilar` and rule
 * 23's locked palace names; nothing here is authored. Positions are deduped and
 * sorted into reading order, so the phrase for a span does not depend on which
 * branch of the pair the relation table happened to list first.

 * @param {string[]} positions any order, duplicates allowed
 * @returns {string|null} null when no position resolves to a palace
