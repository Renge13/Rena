// ── THE CACHE KEY IS WHY DETERMINISM IS A CORRECTNESS BUG ──
// Stage 4 keys on hash(semantic JSON + engine version). Two runs of the same
// chart that differ by one reordered key, or by one float that rounds
// differently, miss the cache and pay for a second LLM call that produces a
// second, different reading of the same birthdate. The whole
// deterministic-after-first-generation guarantee rests on byte-identity, so it
// is asserted rather than assumed.
//
// The emitted JSON keeps its natural, readable key order. The HASH is computed
// over a key-sorted canonical form, so a future refactor that reorders a field
// cannot silently invalidate every cached reading in the table.

/**
 * READING ORDER — the reader meets herself before she meets a finding.

 * importance the Day Master lands wherever its axes put it — 9th of 14 on
 * 1996-10-02 19:20 — so the reading opened on its most dramatic finding and
 * revealed who the reader is one block before the penutup. Reyner read the four
 * production QA readings as the buyer and ruled it not ship-quality (PROGRESS,
 * "MIRROR QA VERDICT 2026-08-10", finding 1).
 *
 * So the identity spine is lifted to the front and everything after it keeps the
 * importance descent untouched. Rule 14: the ORDER is the engine's decision. The
 * renderer is told to write the spine first and is not asked to identify it.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT "SORT SPINE FIRST" ─────────────────────
 * `hierarchy.role === 'spine'` is four facts, and `spouse_palace` is one of
 * them. The Fondasi Pasangan is a PLACE in the chart, not the reader's identity,
 * and hoisting it would put the closest-relationship finding in the opening
 * breath. Role alone cannot separate them.
 *
 * The separation already exists in this file: `core` and `strength` below are
 * the two blocks that state who this person is, and between them they name
 * exactly three things — the day stem, the strength verdict, and the main
 * profile. THAT is the identity set, and these matchers read it off those blocks
 * rather than hard-coding fact ids, so a fact id that changes cannot silently
 * drop a limb of the spine out of the opening. `spouse_palace` appears in
 * neither block and stays in the findings descent, which is the whole point.
 *
 * The third matcher resolves to `main_profile`, or to the CR-1 fact when one
 * fired — CR-1 supersedes the main profile and inherits its standing, and both
 * carry the same Aspek as `core.main_profile`, one on the fact and one on its
 * provenance. `spouse_palace` carries its Aspek as `seat_god`, so it cannot
 * match here by accident.
