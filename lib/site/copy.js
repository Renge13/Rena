// ============================================================
// Rule 20: ONE VOICE EVERYWHERE, INCLUDING CHROME. Every string here is
// user-facing, sits on the same audit surface as the reading itself, and is
// walked by scripts/check-copy.js.
//
// Kept as a bank rather than inlined in the JSX for the reason lib/render/copy.js
// states: a string that lives where it is used is a string nobody audits. It also
// keeps docs/content/_STATIC-STRINGS.md checkable against one file.
//
// THE ENTITY NAME IS NOT DUPLICATED HERE. Labels live in this bank, the name and
// address come from lib/site/entity.js, and the two are composed at render time.
// Two copies of a registered name is one copy too many: the NIB match is what the
// Xendit reviewer checks, and a drifted second copy would pass every test we have.
//
// EACH PAGE'S `meta` IS THE BROWSER-TAB TITLE AND THE SEARCH-RESULT SNIPPET, so it
// is user-facing and belongs here. It lived in the route files until 2026-08-03,
// where check-copy.js could not see it. Note what that move exposes: the titles use
// a MIDDLE DOT (U+00B7), which is not a keyboard character, and they pass only
// because the ban list covers dashes, curly quotes and the ellipsis rather than
// every non-keyboard glyph. The convention predates this file - `app/layout.js`'s
// root title uses it too - so it is left alone rather than quietly changed here.
//
// FORBIDDEN VOCABULARY, and this is commercial rather than cosmetic (rule 25):
// "ramalan", "nasib", "peruntungan" appear nowhere. The reviewer has to read this
// site as digital self-reflection content. Fortune telling is a restricted
// category for payment processors.

   *   `domain` is gone from the write - the domain is not a product (CLAUDE.md
   *   SUPERSEDED) and `createMirrorReading` never wrote one.
   * - NO PHONE NUMBER IS COLLECTED ANY MORE. `wa_number` stopped being collected at
   *   checkout on 2026-08-13, and `interest_wa` - the coming-soon demand capture -
   *   loses its only writer here: `app/api/reading/[id]/interest/route.js` is
   *   deleted with the domain concept, and `setInterest` with it.
   *   `grep -rn "setInterest\|interest_wa" lib app components` -> nothing.
   * - GENDER IS NOW COLLECTED. `grep -n "gender" components/Funnel.jsx` -> the
   *   optional select on the front door. It was correctly unlisted before because
   *   the field did not exist; it exists now because both cards print it.
   * - no email is captured anywhere today, so none is claimed.

   *   captured at the first compatibility checkout. Email identity is

   *   ships, /privasi changes in the same PR that ships it - not before, and not
   *   in the tranche that only adds engine facts. Comment only; nothing here is
   *   user-facing and no string above has changed.
   * - ONE COOKIE, and it is functional. `lib/mirror/session.js` mints an httpOnly

// ============================================================
// UPCOMING_COPY — the two unbuilt products, RULED 2026-08-31
// ============================================================
// Prompt Q commit 4 shipped this block with all eleven strings stubbed. Reyner
// ruled every one of them on 2026-08-31; the ruling, its sweep and the reasoning
// per slot are in `docs/content/upcoming-copy-rulings.md`, which landed on `main`
// alone before this substitution. The values here are VERBATIM from that table -
// punctuation, capitalisation and spacing included, none of it adjusted to match a
// neighbouring string.
//
// Every reader-facing string for the block still lives in this one object, which
// is what made ruling it one file to open rather than a hunt through a 1100-line
// component. Keep it that way for the next one.
//
// ── WHY THE BLOCK SHIPPED STUBBED INSTEAD OF WAITING ──
// Commits 5 and 6 depend on this block EXISTING - the read-out's second
// denominator is `upcoming_seen`, which nothing fires until the block renders. A
// hold here would have blocked two commits on a wording decision that is not on
// their critical path. So the structure lands complete and the words land later,
// and the gate below makes "later" enforceable rather than hopeful.
//
// ── THE SENTINEL: NO SLOT CARRIES ONE NOW, AND THE GATE STAYS ARMED ──
// `PENDING()` wraps an unruled value in `@@UNRULED: ...@@`, deliberately
// unmissable: if one ever renders to a real reader, the bug reports itself in the
// screenshot instead of looking like a slightly odd Indonesian sentence that
// nobody questions. A placeholder that reads plausibly is the one that ships.
//
// `scripts/check-unruled-copy.mjs` REFUSES A PRODUCTION BUILD while any sentinel
// survives (wired as `prebuild`). Preview and local builds are allowed through on
// purpose - Reyner has to SEE the block rendered in order to rule the words, and a
// gate that blocks the preview would block the very review it exists to force.
// The line is production, which is the line that matters: a stub that can reach a
// paying reader is worse than a hold.
//
// IT NOW PASSES, AND NEITHER HALF IS DELETED FOR THAT REASON. The ruling's own
// step 5 is explicit that `PENDING` and the gate stay: they are the gate for the
// NEXT unruled string, and removing a green gate is how it stops existing before
// anyone needs it again. `tests/unruled-copy.spec.mjs` pins that the mechanism
// still works rather than merely that it is quiet.
//
// PRICES ARE NOT HERE. They resolve from `lib/pricing.js` at render time, exactly
// like the Artifact offer, because a price typed into a copy bank is a second
// source of truth for what a thing costs.
//
// COWORK PROPOSED WORDING ON 2026-08-29 and it was kept out of these slots until
// Reyner ruled, because putting an unruled proposal in the slot it would occupy is
// how a proposal becomes a decision by accident. Provenance of the eleven, checked
// against that proposal table rather than remembered:
//
//   6  adopted verbatim from a single proposal - compat.label, compat.sub,
//      annual.label, annual.sub, interestCta, contactLabel
//   1  CHOSEN from a proposed pair - availability, offered as `Belum tersedia`
//      or `Sedang disiapkan`. A selection, not an adoption, and the discarded
//      option is what the slot docblock below records as load-bearing
//   4  his own, never proposed - eyebrow, lead, thanks, contactSubmit
//
// None of that is visible in the finished table, which is why it is written down.
//
// THE LIST ABOVE IS THE 2026-08-29 RECORD AND IT IS LEFT AS IT WAS. `thanks` no
// longer exists as a slot - it was replaced and SPLIT into `interestNoted` and
// `contactSent` on 2026-09-01 (upcoming-copy-rulings.md, AMENDED 2026-09-01), so
// the bank now holds TWELVE strings rather than eleven. Renaming it inside the
// provenance list would make the list say something false about what was proposed
// and by whom, which is the one thing it exists to answer. Provenance of the two
// replacements: both Reyner's, neither proposed, same as the slot they replace.
// ============================================================

// ── COMPAT_COPY ───────────────────────────────────────────
// The strings the standalone paid Compatibility product needs on a surface that
// is NOT a page. Today there is exactly one, and it is the hardest kind:
//
// `invoiceDesc` is the Xendit checkout line AND the buyer's bank or e-wallet
// STATEMENT line. Rule 20 is one composed voice everywhere INCLUDING CHROME, and
// a statement line is chrome, so this is user-facing and Reyner's alone.
//
// IT SHIPS AS A SENTINEL ON PURPOSE, AND A PRODUCTION BUILD REFUSES WHILE IT DOES.
// The alternative was to invent an Indonesian statement line and let it reach a
// real bank statement, or to hold the entire payment path on one string. The
// artifact's own description took three supersessions to settle - two of them for
// exactly this surface (`Katon - CE card + PDF reading` was English on an
// Indonesian buyer's statement, and `Katon - Bacaan lengkap` borrowed the free
// product's own word) - so guessing here has a measured track record of being
// wrong. See app/api/pay/[id]/route.js's header for that history.
//
// PRICES ARE NOT HERE, same as UPCOMING_COPY: they resolve from lib/pricing.js at
// render time, because a price typed into a copy bank is a second source of truth
// for what a thing costs.
