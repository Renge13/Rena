// scripts/check-unruled-copy.mjs — an unruled string may not reach production
// ============================================================
// Prompt Q commit 4. `UPCOMING_COPY` ships with every value stubbed, because
// Reyner is the sole authority on Indonesian register and had not ruled the
// wording, and holding the commit would have blocked commits 5 and 6 on it.
//
// This is the thing that makes a stub safe to ship. Without it, "we will fill
// those in later" is a sentence in a PR body, and a sentence in a PR body has
// never once stopped a deploy.
//
//   npm run check:unruled           report, exit 0    (the hold is legitimate)
//   npm run check:unruled -- --strict   refuse, exit 1
//
// ── WHERE THE LINE IS, AND WHY IT IS NOT "EVERY BUILD" ──
// Strict fires on a PRODUCTION build only: `--strict`, or `VERCEL_ENV=production`.
// PREVIEW AND LOCAL BUILDS PASS ON PURPOSE. Reyner cannot rule wording he cannot
// see, and this block is the only part of prompt Q a reader can look at; a gate
// that killed the preview build would block the exact review it exists to force,
// and the predictable result is that someone deletes the gate to get a link.
// Production is the line that matters - that is where a reader who is not Reyner
// would meet a placeholder.
//
// ── WHY IT IS NOT FOLDED INTO check-copy.js ──
// That script enforces rule 20 (keyboard characters only) over every copy bank
// and fails `npm test`. This one must NOT fail `npm test`, because the stub is a
// legitimate state of the branch for as long as the ruling is outstanding. Same
// shape, different verdict, so it is a different instrument.
// ============================================================

// ── EVERY BANK THAT CAN CARRY A SENTINEL, 2026-09-07 ──────
// This scanned UPCOMING_COPY and nothing else, because that was the only bank
// with stubbed values when it was written. `COMPAT_COPY` now has one too, and a
// gate that cannot see the bank it is supposed to guard is not a gate - it is a
// green check beside a live placeholder, which is this repo's most-repeated
// failure shape.
//
// KEYED BY NAME so the report says WHICH bank, and a bank added without a row
// here is the same hole again. When the next one appears, add it.
