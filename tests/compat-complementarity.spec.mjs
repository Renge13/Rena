// WHAT THIS ASSERTS, AND WHAT IT CANNOT.
//
// There is NO ORACLE FOR A PAIR CLAIM (Joey Yap's plotter is single-chart, probed
// 2026-08-12), so nothing here claims a pair "really is" complementary. Every
// expectation asserts INTERNAL CONSISTENCY: that `compatComplementarity` reads the
// two existing functions it is supposed to read, in the order they already define,
// and combines them without re-ranking or recomputing anything.
//
// THE TWO SOURCES, and they are deliberately different computations:
//   computeStrength(chart).favorable   lib/bazi/strength.ts:628-643, returned :660
//       The favourable elements, ALREADY ORDERED BY SCARCITY - `byScarcity` at
//       :629 sorts ascending on elementTotals, so favorable[0] is the scarcest and
//       therefore the most needed. This module does not re-sort that list; it walks
//       it in the engine's own priority order and takes the first hit.
//   elementPresence(chart)             lib/semantic/facts.js:121
//       Presence as percent of the chart's total weight, over
//       `chart.elementBalance` = countElements() at lib/bazi/buildChart.js:80.
//
// PRESENCE IS NOT STRENGTH, AND THAT IS RULE 9. `strength.elementStrength` is a
// seasonal strength distribution; `elementPresence` counts what the chart actually
// holds. Rule 9 forbids treating display normalisation as a strength score, and the
// live version of that confusion is using one of these where the other belongs. A
// supplier supplies what it HOLDS, so presence is correct here and the spec asserts
// the module never reaches for elementStrength.
//
// ABSENCE MEANS EXACTLY ZERO, and the threshold is not this module's to invent.
// lib/semantic/facts.js:297 fires `element_absent` on `if (pct > 0) continue` - so
// absent is presence === 0, and `sameImbalance` uses the same test.
//
// THE EXPECTED VALUES BELOW WERE PRINTED FROM THOSE TWO FUNCTIONS, 2026-09-07,
// not derived from the module under test:
//
//   $ node --input-type=module -e "... computeStrength(c); elementPresence(c) ..."
//     chart   1  weak      fav Wood,Fire        absent Wood
//                presence  Wood 0    Fire 27.5  Earth 15    Metal 20    Water 37.5
//     chart   5  balanced  fav Wood,Fire        absent Metal
//                presence  Wood 17.5 Fire 20    Earth 53.8  Metal 0     Water 8.8
//     chart 101  weak      fav Wood,Fire        absent Wood   (chart 1, no hour)
//                presence  Wood 0    Fire 26.7  Earth 18.3  Metal 21.7  Water 33.3
//     chart 105  balanced  fav Metal,Water,Earth  absent Metal  (chart 5, no hour)
//                presence  Wood 16.7 Fire 26.7  Earth 55    Metal 0     Water 1.7
