// No network and no API key. The provider is stubbed through `globalThis.fetch`,
// the pattern tests/mirror-route.spec.mjs uses, so "a cache hit makes zero
// provider calls" is asserted against a stub that THROWS if touched rather than
// against the absence of a key - which would make it vacuously true.
//
// ══ THE FLOOR IS SERVABLE NOW, AND IT WAS NOT AN HOUR AGO ══
// Reyner's 24 `kompatibilitas` cells were applied on 2026-09-08. Before that the
// floor was assembled out of `@@UNRULED: kompat_*@@` placeholders and could not
// be served at all; this file asserted the refusal. It now asserts the serve.
//
// THE TWO GUARDS THAT STOOD IN THE WAY ARE BOTH STILL ARMED, and that is what
// the last test here is for. Neither was deleted for going quiet:
//
//   1. `floorRefusalReason` - the mirror's policy, imported. It hard-failed on
//      the placeholder floor and, later, on `fact.condition_named` when
//      `p0_names` had no cell. Both causes are gone; the policy is not.
//   2. The SENTINEL guard in `lib/pair/serveReading.js`. It exists because at one
//      point the placeholder floor produced only SOFT findings, so
//      `floorRefusalReason` returned null and a paying customer would have
//      received a page of `@@UNRULED@@` at HTTP 200. It is unreachable today and
//      it is the one that guards the NEXT unruled cell.
