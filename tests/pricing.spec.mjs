// ============================================================
// tests/pricing.spec.mjs — the ladder, and the fence in front of it
// ============================================================
// Added 2026-08-29 with prompt Q commit 1. There was NO test file for
// `lib/pricing.js` before this, which is why `annual` could be added without
// anything failing: the SKU table is read by the checkout route and by the
// Xendit webhook, and both of those are security surfaces (rule 18).
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS ACTUALLY GUARDING, and it is not the numbers. The numbers are
// Reyner's and they will change again - the launch tier is explicitly the test
// variable. What must NEVER drift is the relationship between three things:
//
//   1. a SKU having a PRICE                 (SKUS)
//   2. a SKU being SELLABLE                 (SELLABLE_SKUS)
//   3. an amount UNLOCKING a reading        (amountMatchesSku)
//
// Adding a price must not add a checkout, and adding a checkout must not widen
// what any other SKU's invoice accepts. Those two sentences are the whole file.
// ============================================================
