// tests/unruled-copy.spec.mjs — the stub is allowed to exist, not to ship
// ============================================================
// Prompt Q commit 4 shipped `UPCOMING_COPY` with every value stubbed, because
// Reyner rules Indonesian register and had not ruled this block, and holding the
// commit would have blocked commits 5 and 6 behind a wording decision.
//
// HE RULED ALL ELEVEN ON 2026-08-31 AND EVERY ASSERTION HERE STAYED GREEN, which
// is what the section below predicted and the reason it was built that way. The
// file did not need editing to survive the event it exists for; one test was ADDED
// (PENDING still stamps a catchable sentinel), because passing is exactly the
// state in which a gate gets deleted as dead scaffolding.
//
// ── WHAT THIS FILE IS ACTUALLY ASSERTING ──
// NOT "the copy is correct" - nobody can assert that until Reyner rules it. It
// asserts the three things that make shipping a stub safe rather than hopeful:
//
//   1. THE DETECTOR DETECTS. `scanUnruled` is exercised on synthetic input, both
//      directions, so it is not a function that has only ever been pointed at one
//      object and pronounced working.
//   2. THE GATE IS WIRED. `prebuild` invokes it, so a production build runs it
//      without anyone remembering to.
//   3. THE GATE'S VERDICT MATCHES REALITY. Strict mode refuses exactly when
//      placeholders remain, and passes exactly when they do not.
//
// ── IT STAYS GREEN THROUGH REYNER'S EDIT, DELIBERATELY ──
// Every assertion here holds in BOTH states - all-stubbed today, all-ruled after
// he fills the bank. A spec that went red the moment the ruling landed would
// punish the exact edit it exists to invite, and the person hitting that red
// would fix it by deleting the spec. The state change is enforced by the
// production gate, which is where a hold belongs; this file protects the gate.
//
// The one thing it does check about the CONTENT is that no price lives in the
// bank. Prices resolve from lib/pricing.js at render time, and a number typed
// into a copy bank is a second source of truth for what a thing costs.
// ============================================================
